Like a lot of women my age, I got diagnosed with autism as an adult. After growing up being the abnormal normal kid, finally getting a diagnosis after years of searching felt like a relief. On the other hand it was also just the confirmation of something long suspected. It was big, and at the same time small to non-existent. One word isn’t going to change who you are, is it? Of course, it isn’t, you still are the same wonderful person. But while the world carries on with 99.99% of its people not even knowing something happened, and you continue to be your beautiful self, some things do change. Here is a list of the 8 most important changes as I remember them.

## 1. The Benchmark shift

Every one of us has an internal benchmark. It is the invisible person we try to be. If it is closer to who we are, or at least within reach, we are happy. The further away it is from who we are or even who we could be, the unhappier we become.

Before my diagnosis, my benchmark was somewhere upper normal average. It was my deepest wish to just fit in. The ‘upper’ part however didn’t come from my desire to be extraordinary, but from the fact that throughout my life people had called me smart, and had connected to that the expectation that I would do something useful with this precious resource called brain.

Over the years my inner benchmark had developed to something that I could only reach with huge efforts. Day after day I would put on the tiring act of trying to be upper-class-normal. At times losing motivation, at times trying even harder, I would eventually fall down somewhere, exhausted. Had I reached it? Had it slipped away out of my fingers? Was it already out of sight again?

Without an official diagnosis I didn’t see a reason to change my benchmark. Of course, I could have left out upper (and I did do that a couple of times), but this part didn’t seem to be the most challenging.

Even after I had heard the liberating words of my autism diagnosis, my benchmark didn’t change itself. I had to do it. The most important rule that helped me with that is “Don’t make things unnecessary hard”. Slowly I managed to shift my benchmark until it was within reach again, and with that, I became a happier person.

## 2. Hobbies are now called special interests

This one really seems like a minor change, doesn’t it? But as small and unimportant as it is, I thought I might as well embrace it. No more worrying about how much time I am allowed to spend on things I like most. Whether I should not stop doing this or that and instead do horribly unpredictable and noisy things like hanging out with friends, going shopping or even to a disco.

Special interests allow me to travel places or visit courses during my free time. I really enjoy taking a week off to go to a course, workshop or summer school on an interesting topic. Also, reading travel guides of each country in the world or looking up other countries train tables isn’t to crazy for a special interest. And if I am tired of one topic, I just move on to the next one. We are talking about the modern interpretation of special interests here: it has long become clear that multiple special interests can co-exist, both in series and in parallel.

I have to admit that in my eyes most of my hobbies are just hobbies even if you call them special interests. Except for this one maybe: I would never have dared to call my habit of spending multiple days reading half the internet to find everything there is to know about a random fact I read or heard about a hobby, but it fits just fine under the special interest label.

I love to use the concept of special interest to decouple what I like from social expectations. It's a pity that some people tend to use it as something that makes autistic people less human, as there is nothing so beautifully and profoundly human as wanting to do things that make you happy.

## 3. Finally feeling like you belong

It is very common for people to read up on autism after diagnosis, and that's what I did too. Luckily there are a lot of excellent resources from the hand of #actuallyautistic people. Whether it is books or blogs, they all have in common that they are telling about the life and quirks of people like me. I can still hardly suppress my amazement when reading something that I feel exactly the same way. It is such a wonderful feeling. Of course each story also contains elements that are not like me at all. But like each person on the spectrum is different, each story you read is different, some differ more, some less. But in each of them I can discover new things that make me feel like I belong, which is why reading them is so addicting.

## 4. The “What if it's all not true” anxiety

Feeling like you belong somewhere is very beautiful of course, but I didn't and don't feel that way all the time. Sometimes I feel just as abnormal, lonely and not good enough as I did before. Anxiety kept happily stabbing holes in my belonging pink air balloon. And keeps doing so from time  to time (although less frequent than it used to) until today.

I had gotten my diagnosis, everything was fine again. I understood myself a lot better now. Most of the time I felt as described in the previous point. But then some times I was not so sure anymore. I might have said to myself: Hey, but I’ve been on an international exchange, can I be autistic than? Or I’ve been to busy places before and I managed, but now I have to leave early, maybe it’s just self-pity? Other people may have no problem talking to other people, even on the phone, and then read a lot about those who can’t do that, and ask themselves whether they can still have autism. Or you might have this persistent "I just have to try harder" attitude like me, that doesn't just go away after diagnosis.

All of those doubts and questions have a logical answer: These characteristics make you more you, but not less autistic. They are often based on  misconceptions and prejudices to begin with, but it also touches the point that diversity and categorization aren't contradictory. The only problem was that this was not the answer my brain was telling me during my anxiety phases.

So what can you do when anxiety creeps up on you like that? With the huge amount of books, blogs and testimonies out there, there are probably some you can relate better to. Hold on to those. Focus on the similarities and blame the spectrum for the differences. I mean not all neurotypical people experience the same set of difficulties, do they?

Another thing I did is talking to my diagnosing psychiatrist. She kindly assured me that she was pretty certain my diagnosis was right. Also, she is very good at reminding me of those things about reality I know as well but choose to sometimes ignore.

## 5. Having to explain yourself to people that are against diagnosis

Well maybe they aren’t strictly speaking against diagnosis. They think it is a good thing for some people. But don’t understand why I  would need one. (After all I don't look autistic #sarcasm.) They are often people I’ve known for a while. They think I am fitting in quite well, and don’t see the amount of energy it costs me to adapt myself this way. Therefore, they wonder why I want to give myself this label. Often they even start a rant about labeling and pigeonholing in our society, and blame me of taking part in this.

To be honest this wasn’t exactly the kind of support I was expecting when telling people about my diagnosis. Saying I didn’t have an answer ready the first time I got this kind of reaction is probably an understatement. I really wanted to cry and run away. I wished I hadn’t said anything about it. Instead, I passed the blame to someone else, said I hadn’t chosen for it, but my work situation had made it necessary, which was somewhere near the truth but in my eyes it is still a lie I do regret.

In the mean time I am better prepared. I tell myself to stay calm. That I don’t even have to react to this if I don’t want to. It is my life and my choice. Their reaction just proves that I have been adapting well in the past and that the problems of autistic people do often remain invisible.

When I’m in the mood for explaining I often start of by saying that I do agree that thoughtless labeling has disadvantages, this way they might be more willing to actually start listening to me. Then I explain that the main advantage of this diagnosis is that it allows me to be more like myself. I try to give them examples of adaptations I make in order to be able to sit with them in the restaurant we are having this discussion in, or other examples they haven’t noticed before. I often end by saying that I understand and accept that they are against overambitious labeling. But also that the person affected by the label is the only one that is in the position to decide whether the label is necessary or not.

## 6. Getting to meet new extraordinary people

Although the Autistic community is not always and everywhere very well organized, there are still plenty of possibilities to meet other autistic people. Whether you join twitter or one of the many internet forums and meet them online, or join a local self-help group, of which there are plenty in most European countries.

It might need some fine-tuning to find those people you really can connect to, you don’t need to become friends with all of them of course. As an introverted person, I find groups with a lot of extroverts a bit heavy sometimes. I’ve been to a couple of meetings of different groups and now I’m part of a wonderful aspergerwomen group in my city which I really like.

There are also a couple of conferences by and for autistic people such as Autminds in the Netherlands and Autscape in the UK. They differ a lot in size, organization level accessibility and even mindset.

Another option is of course to use your hobbies/special interests to connect to people, something you might or might not have been doing before your diagnosis.

## 7. Learning to control the energy levels

Well, at least I might have gotten a bit better at it then I was before.

Personally, before my diagnosis, I didn’t have a clue about how I was using my energy. Mostly I went full speed ahead, doing one hundred things at the same time, and then at some point crashed. After that I stayed quiet for some time, before picking up speed again. I know I sometimes flipped out at supermarkets or other places with lots of noise and people, but I didn’t really know why such things happened.

I cannot say I’m an energy expert now, but at least I have a better understanding of what makes me tired and when I need to take a break. Energy quickly became an important part of my explanation of what autism means to me. I know I can do a lot of things neurotypical people do. I’ve done them all the time to try to fit in. But I also know now that they cost me way more energy. Therefore, I need to consider when it’s worth it.

## 8. New questions arise

Or maybe they are just the old questions seen in a new light. Let me give you some examples:

### Relationships

Before diagnosis, I had never given it much thought whether being in a relationship (like a particular relationship, not relationships in general) was worth it for me, energy-wise for example. Or that it might be worth trying to fit my just leave me alone for a couple of days because I need to recharge my batteries mode into a relationship instead of ignoring it.

And as relationships live of some kind of balance of giving and taking, the idea that autistic-neurotypical relationships (or even abled-disabled relationships in general) could get out of balance more easily was very scary at first. If the other person takes over some tasks that cost me a lot of energy, is that OK or will it break everything? Can someone who needs lots of planning live together or be best friends with someone who thinks planning restricts their freedom? I had always thought I could keep the balance by trying harder to be normal, but after diagnosis I came to realise that if things were supposed to work out, I needed to find a different way.

I used to see being in a relationship as a way of proving how normal I am. So naturally, once I didn't have to prove my normality anymore, everything about them changed. I do admit they became more complex. But I also became more thoughtful about them and took more ownership. I see the arising problems from a different angle and propose different solutions than I would have before my diagnosis.

### Jobs and Careers

Classical jobs and career paths are just not thought for people with autism. This can be clearly seen by unemployment rates among autistic people being alarmingly high.

Even having a job, the classic career ladder very often involves people taking on group leadership or client facing roles at some point. So how can I keep gaining value (you have to, as you get more expensive too) while doing things I love and am good had? How to kindly decline the offer, or decidedly refuse the pressing request? How to find my own way when everything around me is business and negotiation?

It is true that I could have thought about those things before, but they didn't seem so present back then. Or maybe they just didn't have the same unpredictability about them. At least I had the illusion that there were beaten tracks to follow, so I didn't really have to figure out my own way.

### Disclosure

This last question is definitely a new one though. And it's big too.

To disclose or not to disclose? To tell or to lie?  To be myself or to act? The answer should be easy, and if it ever gets easy for everyone we'll know that we've managed to become an inclusive and accepting society (or exactly the opposite).

I know I am extremely privileged (being white, living in a rich country, getting lots of support, having a job I love, ...) and even for me the disclosure question is a tricky one. I might be at a meeting and wonder whether it is safe to stim there(the answer is probably no). Or this year at university, I wanted to participate in an extracurricular workshop. I said I was autistic and the workshop leader refused to let me take part. She said she wouldn0t be able to give me the appropriate support (although I had said the only thing I needed was the possibility to get out when it would be getting too much) and offered me a much more expensive one-on-one session instead (which of course I didn't take).  So even for me, disclosure isn't always easy, and it is probably much harder for most autistic people.

For me diagnosis was definitely more than just getting a label. A number of important things changed because of it. Did you get an ASD diagnosis? What did it change in your life?

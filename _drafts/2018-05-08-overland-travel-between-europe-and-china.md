We can fly everywhere these days, usually it is just a matter of a couple of hours and, considering the impact on the environment, way too little money. Seeing the world and filling your social media accounts with selfies in exotic destinations has never been this easy. But maybe you are up to the challenge and want to do all of this without flying or driving your own car? Of course you will need more time, and possibly also more money. But this is the kind of journey where the route becomes the destination, and you will actually get to experience the world instead of flying over it.

Researching overland travel (the not self-driving variation) is a hobby of mine. This article will cover destinations worldwide, and how to travel in between them. I'll mostly cover train and bus travel, but also discuss how to cross oceans by freighter or sailing ship, as well as cycling and organized travel by overland truck where appropriate. If you want to learn more about overlanding in the sense of traveling the world in your own vehicle, this is not the right place though. I don't own a vehicle or even a drivers license, so this topic is not part of my research.

The Article is split up into several blog posts. I've added a table of contents here so that you can keep the overview.

> Except for a winter trip on the trans-Mongolian railway I don't have real life experience with any of the routes outside Europe. This article is therefore meant as a source of inspiration, not as a ready made and tested travel itinerary. I try my best to keep it up to date though, so if you find it contains outdated information, let me know.

As I am living in Europe, that is where we'll start exploring. And from this point of view, there is a large landmass to be discovered in the east. It is possible to go as far east as Vladivostok and as far South as Singapore without even having to cross any water. If you are okay with taking a ferry or even a freighter, the possibilities get wilder, and there is nothing even stopping you from surrounding the globe. But let's start with the beginning.

Most routes from Europe towards the east will pass through Moscow. With the only well documented alternative being a route through Turkey and across the Caspian sea to Kazakhstan ([Jump to the Caspian sea route](#caspian)). Although even this one is significantly more advanced than any of the Russia routes. Any route further south (aka the [hippie trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie_trail)) is way out of my adventurousness-scale.

## From Europe to Moscow

If you are not in Scandinavia or the Baltics already, your most direct overland route to Moscow will probably be by sleeper train via Berlin. It passes through Poland and Belarus. (You will probably need a transit visa for the latter, as well as a normal tourist visa for Russia.) If you have to pass through Paris to get to Berlin, you can even take a direct train from Paris to Moscow, following the same route. It takes a little bit less than 40 hours to cover the whole stretch from Paris to Moscow (leaving in the evening, arriving the second morning after), and about 24 hours from Berlin to Moscow (Leaving in the morning, arriving the next morning, or leaving in the evening, arriving the next evening, depending on which train you choose). As is always the case for trains and ferries, you can find more information on seat61.com: [Paris-Moscow](https://www.seat61.com/paris-moscow-express.htm), [Berlin-Moscow](https://www.seat61.com/international-trains/trains-from-Berlin.htm#Berlin-Russia)

If you are in, or want to pass through Scandinavia, Copenhagen - Stockholm - Helsinki - St-Petersburg - Moscow might be the route you're looking for. First  you travel by train to Copenhagen, than another train to Stockholm, from where you can take the ferry to Finland and then the train to St-Petersburg. Again this Journey is covered by seat61: [To Helsinki](https://www.seat61.com/Finland.htm#London_to_Helsinki_by_Eurostar_&_daytime_trains), [Helsinki to St-Petersburg and Moscow](https://www.seat61.com/helsinki-to-st-petersburg-by-train.htm).

Last but not least you can also get to Russia via the Baltic states. Although the train lines are still there from Soviet times, train connections have broken up, and especially Lithuania is not well connected to the international rail system. There is no convenient direct train connection between Warsaw in Poland and Vilnius in Lithuania (you have to change trains twice, see [seat61](https://www.seat61.com/warsaw-to-vilnius-by-train.htm)). Neither are there any trains between Lithuania and its neighbor Latvia. So you might want to look into bus connections for this leg.

Once in Riga you can rely on trains again, or stick to the buses if you prefer. From here on, there are direct trains to Moscow that don't require you to pass through Belarus (in case you want to avoid the transit visa). There is also a train to St. Petersburg, if you want to make a little detour. If you want to visit the third Baltic state before crossing into Russia, you can take a train to the Estonian border, from where there is a good connection to Tallinn. Tallinn then again has train connections to St. Petersburg and Moscow.

Another way into the Baltic states is the Baltic sea. Each of the three countries has at least one port with ferry connections to Germany, Scandinavia or both.

## From Moscow to the east

Moscow is the starting point of the famous trans-Siberian railway. Which actually consists of 3 different routes, each with at least one train a week in each direction going all the way through, as well as regional trains. The route doesn't split up until as far east as Ulan-Ude though, giving you plenty of train choices if you want to stop off before that. One popular stop is Irkutsk, from where you can visit lake Baikal, the largest fresh water lake (by volume) in the world.  It is popular with Russian tourists in the summer. But I really enjoyed being there in late winter, when the lake is completely frozen with ice more than a meter thick.

Anyway, at some point you'll want to choose which Route you want to take, so let me tell you a bit more about your options.

### Transsiberian x3

Option 1 is to take the "real" **trans-Siberian route**, all the way to Vladivostok. From where you can take a ferry to Donghae in South-Korea and Sakaiminato in Japan. (Jump to South-Korea and Japan section)

The second option is probably the most popular one: the so called **trans-Mongolian route**. From Ulan-Ude it goes south into Mongolia and then east again towards Beijing in China. Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia is a good place to get off if you want to explore the nomadic culture and the beautiful nature of this fascinating country. Besides the Transmongolian line, there is no train system here. But buses go mainly from the capital to each regional capital and back. If you don't have much time, you can still visit Terelj or Khustai national park (known for the Przewalski's horse), as both are close to Ulaanbaatar. If you have a little bit more time you can visit the old capital of the mongolian empire Karakorum, or organize a trip into the Gobi desert. Or if you have plenty of time, get as far as Khovsgol lake, or into the Altai mountains.

The third option is called the **trans-Manchurian** and is the one that is often forgotten. It goes to Beijing as well, but doesn't pass through Mongolia. It also takes longer to reach its destination. This train does pass through the Chinese city Harbin, so if you want to pass by its world famous Ice and snow sculpture festival, this is your train. Together with a visit to the frozen lake Baikal in Russia, this would make an amazing trip for winter lovers.

### Through Kazakhstan

The fourth option to go east from Moscow has little to do with any of the trans-Siberian routes. It involves taking a train from Moscow to Kazakhstan, and then on to Urumqi in West-China. Kazakhstan features mountains with skiing slopes as well as desert and steppe. It also has connecting trains to some of the neighboring Stans (Uzbekistan, Kirghistan). But this route is more adventurous than the trans-Siberian ones. Be sure to read up on the border crossing with China for example.

## Across the Caspian sea
{: #caspian }
###  About this route

This route follows the traces of the Silk road. It also is quite a bit more challenging than the above variations on the trans-Siberian. You first want to get yourself to Turkey. From there you travel to Azerbaijan on the west shore of the Caspian sea. Here you can catch a "ferry" to Aktau in Kazakhstan. Aktau is connected by train to the rest of Kazakhstan, so getting to Almaty near the Chinese border shouldn't be a problem. From here you can then get to Urumqi in China, as described above for the Moscow-Kazakhstan route.

What is often referred to as the Caspian sea ferry is actually a couple of cargo ships on different routes on the Caspian sea, and is without doubt the weakest link on this route, as it has no fixed schedule. If you want a schedule you can stick to, choose one of the train connections through Russia, which are quite reliable.

### Itinerary

![Istanbul city picture take from the water(Bosporus). Bosporus with ships in the foreground, behind that several buildings tightly packed. Galata Tower peeking out in the middle](img/istanbul.jpg "Turkey: View of Istanbul from the Bosporus")
*Turkey: View of Istanbul from the Bosporus*

From Europe, you can enter Turkey either overland through Istanbul, or by ferry from the Greek islands to Izmir (ports of AyvalÄ±k, ÃeÅme, KuÅadasÄ±) or further south (ports of Bodrum, Marmaris). The overland option is described in all detail on [seat61.com: London to Istanbul by Train](https://www.seat61.com/Turkey.htm). The ferry option requires you to first get to Athens, for example by ferry from Bari in Italy. Then take a ferry to one of the islands that are connected with Turkey. That is, from north to south: Lesvos, Chios, Samos, Kos, or Rhodos. Some ferry connections are seasonal, others are operated all year round.

If you enter in the south-west by ferry, you might as well pick up some sights in this region. The old Greek city of Ephesos for example, Pamukkale, or Cappadocia, or walk (part of) the incredibly beautiful Lycian way if you like hiking. Getting around by train in Turkey is well possible (and again described on [the dedicated seat61 page](https://www.seat61.com/Turkey2.htm)), but Turkish people often prefer to travel by bus. The bus network is extensive and well organized, with modern long distance buses on most lines.

![Travertine teraces, filled with clear blue water.](img/pamukkale.jpg "Turkey: Pamukkale")
*Turkey: Pamukkale*

When you've seen enough of Turkey, you'll want to get to the eastern black sea coast to cross the border with Georgia. Make your way to either Rize or Trabson on the coast, or to Kars, a bit more inland, and then take a bus to the border at Sarp, and on to Batumi in Georgia. From here you can travel by train to Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, and on to Baku in Azerbaijan.

Lots of information on the 'ferry', and actually all of the silk road, can be found on the [caravanistan website](http://caravanistan.com/transport/caspian-sea-ferry/) and the attached forum.

### A detour to visit Iran

![Decorated walls and domed roof in red and blue, seen from the inside.](img/iran.jpg "Iran: Ali Qapu palace in Isfahan")
*Iran: Ali Qapu palace in Isfahan*

If you are up to the adventure you can add a detour to Iran to complete your silk-road trip. Turkmenistan is a rather complicated country to get into. Although getting a transit visa is possible and probably your best bet to travel independently. For the less adventurous Iran is kind of a dead end though, and you will need to backtrack to Azerbaijan to continue your journey across the Caspian sea.

There used to be a train from Ankara in Turkey to Teheran, the capital of Iran, but this service has been canceled due to security problems related to the Kurdish conflict in Eastern Turkey. If you want to cross into Iran from Turkey, you will have to take a bus from Van in Turkey to Tabris in Iran. The other option is to cross the Azerbaijan-Iran border, which can be done by train. None of these connections are very stable though, borders may close or the situation in the region may escalate.

If you ask yourself why are we even in Beijing, you might want to have a look at the first article of this series, where I describe several routes from Europe to Asia, some of which terminate in Beijing.

Once in Beijing the vast Chinese railway network is yours to explore. I'll discuss a few possible routes in the sections below, but endless variations are possible, depending on your interests, time constraints, and where you want to get to next.
To South-Korea and Japan
Ferry connections between China, South-Korea and Japan

There are plenty of ferries crossing the yellow sea between China and South Korea. On the South Korean side Incheon is the main port. Seat61s Korea page suggests the chinese ports of Qingdao and Tianjin, but there are many more, icluding Dalian and Dandong (near the North-Korean border).

Between South-Korean and Japan most ferries land in Busan on the Korean side. Except for the Vladivostok-Donghae-Sakaiminato Ferry described earlier. Busan is connected with the closeby Shimonoseki and Hakata ports in Japan, as well as with the further away Osaka.

Osaka is the place to be also for your connection between Japan and China. From here there are ferries to Shanghai.
South-Korea

South Korea has a good train and even better long distance bus system. Also over the past few years, they have been developing a national cycle network, making the country into South Asias cycler paradise. The most recent overview map of the network I've found is this one. But if you want more detail, you'd better learn some Hangul (the Korean script, I promise, it is really cool to learn and much easier than Chinese characters ) and have a look at Naver (one of Korea's search engines, which also has map search including those bike paths, here is a guide on how to use it).

Other popular outdoor activities include hiking and skiing. The mountaineous country has lots of national parks with great, often well maintained hiking trails. One of them, the Bukhansan National park is even partly on the Capitals territory. So no reason not to also burn some calories while sampling your way through the delicious Korean cuisine. If you are in for a more spiritual experience, the country's templestay program, offers you the chance to spend some time in one of the many Budhist temples.
Japan

I am not at all a Japan expert, so I won't keep you up here to long, boring you with what little I do know. Just a few basic things: Japan has an excellent railway system. Also they have a railway pass for tourists, offering 7, 14 or 21 days of railway travel. You can read everything about this on the seat61 Japan page. Also, if you like hiking, check out the kumano kodo, a network of old pilgrimage routes featured in UNESCO's world heritage list.
Heading south towards Southeast-Asia

Let me describe two possible routes from Beijing to Bangkok. An eastern, you might even say coastal route, through Vietnam and Cambodia. And a more inland route through Laos. Although not included in the described routes, crossing borders between Vietnam and Laos, as well as Cambodia and Laos is no problem. Therefor there are almost no limits to mixing and matching both routes, as long as you have the time.
Eastern China - Vietnam - Cambodia - Thailand

First, from Beijing, head to Shanghai. A 1300 km journey that can be done in less than four hours and thirty minutes using the high speed train. After visiting both Beijing and Shanghai, you've probably had your share of chinese mega-city atmosphere. So from here let's get to Guilin, known for its beautiful karst landscape. There is one day train taking 9 hours, as well as a couple of sleeper trains taking about 20 hours.

If you have no interest in visiting Shanghai, you can of course also take a direct overnight train from Beijing to Guilin. From here it is only two and a half hours by train to Nanning, from where the sleeper train to Hanoi departs. You'll be in Hanoi early the next morning!

The daily train service between Hanoi and Saigon is sometimes referred to as the reunification express, but the train is not officially called this way. You can ride the whole stretch in one haul, taking a full day and another night. Or you can get off somewhere in between.

After Saigon you'll need to live without trains for a while. Buses will probably be your main way of transport all the way through Cambodia. The Journey exists of 3 Legs. Saigon to Phnom Penh, Phnom Penh to Siem Reap and Siem Reap to Bangkok. If you have the money and want something different, river cruises are also popular on the first two legs.

If you absolutely want to ride a train in Cambodia, there is one on weekends and holidays, connecting Phnom Penh with Campot (famous for its pepper) and Sihanoukville.

This route greatly coincides with part of the itinerary described on the Europe to Australia without flying page on the seat61 website.
Western China - Laos- Thailand

For this itinerary lets take a more inland route through China. The first leg of this route takes us from Beijing To Xi'an. This can be done either by high speed train during the day in 5 to 6 hours, our by overnight sleeper. From here you can either take a train to Chengdu directly, or you can venture a bit further west, to discover the Chinese (non autonomous) part of the Tibetan plateau.

When talking about Tibet we often think about the autonomous region, with its capital Lhasa, as well as the Mount Everest. However ethnic Tibet covers a much larger aria. This part of Tibet no one ever talks about consists of the Amdo and Kham regions. And while you need a special permit to travel the autonomic region of Tibet, Amdo and Kham are technically just part of China and therefore can be accessed freely most of the time. (Access has been restricted in the past during periods of Tibetan protests.)

To visit Amdo and Kham  from Xi'an, you should first take the train to Xining. From there you can work your way down to Chengdu using local buses. Visiting several Tibetan towns and monasteries along the way. A good description can be found on the Land of Snows website, which is in general an excellent resource about travelling in all regions of Tibet. Towards the end of this leg, there are also 2 national parks to be visited. Huanglong national park and Jiuzhaigou national park. From here you are only a one day bus ride away from Chengdu and its famous pandas.

From Chengdu you can continue by train to Kunming, a Journey of around 20 hours, depending on the train. Or, if you want to see even more of Tibet by bus, you can follow Land of Snows route to Shangri La, from where you can travel on to Kunming via Dali.

If from here you decide to travel on via Vietnam and Cambodia instead of Laos, you can either take a high speed train to Nanning or a bus or train to Hekou on the Vietnamese border, and continue by night train to Hanoi.

From Kunming there is a direct overnight bus to Luang Prabang, but it is a long ride and travellers are often discouraged from taking this bus on online forums. However it is also possible to split up the journey, and take only day buses. In this case, first head to Jinghong (Xishuangbanna), a full day ride. From there it goes on to Mengla and the Mohan border. Once in Laos most people head to either Luang Namtha or Luang Prabang.

In Laos you will probably mainly travel by bus or boat. You can either cross the border to northern Thailand in Ban Houayxay to continue to Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai. From Chiang Mai there are sleeper trains to the Thai capital Bangkok. Alternatively, you can travel to the Laotian capital of Vientane first, and cross into Thailand from there. Or, if you want to visit all of Laos, as well as Cambodia, travel all the way down to the border between southern Laos and Cambodia.
Thailand - Malaysia - Singapore

There is a train line all the way from Bangkok to Singapore. You'll have to switch trains, but wouldn't you want to stop off a couple of times anyway? If you want to visit specific beach resorts or islands in South Thailand, you might have to throw in some buses as well (and ferries of course).

From Singapore, you can continue to Indonesia. Island hopping all the way to Australia is not possible though. If that's what you want, take a freighter from Singapore instead.
Cycling South-east Asia

I am mostly talking about trains and buses here, but cycling is also a great way of overland travel. TDA Global Cycling is the most well known travel provider for long distance cycling, or Global Bicycle expeditions as they call it. Their focus is to challenge cyclists rather than touristic sightseeing, and would therefore be too hardcore for a lot of people. Their Shanghai to Singapore tour called Bamboo roads for example totals 7321 km on 62 riding days plus 20 rest days. That is almost 120 km a day with a resting day on every fourth day on average.

For those looking for something less hardcore there are several travel companies that offer cycle tours. They are usual more focussed on sightseeing than TDA's expeditions. SpiceRoads is just one example. Their roadbike options do average  well over 100km a day as well, but they are far from the same total length as TDA's expeditions. And they also have tours with a more leisurely pace. Some of their trips are round tours, others aren't. Some of the point to point options include Saigon to Angkor, Hanoi to Luang Prabang, Hanoi to Siem Reap and Saigon to Bangkok. If you look at there itineraries you will notice that SpiceRoads tours often cover part of the distance by road transfers, so you are not necessarily cycling the whole distance. A few itineraries also include a flight, so watch out for that if you don't want to fly.

Note: I am not bound in any way to those companies, they just were the ones that turned up in my research. Know other companies providing similar tours? Please let me know, and I will add them as options.
Trough Tibet and Nepal to India

From the 1950s till the late 1970s  the so called hippie trail was a popular overland rout from Europe to India. This route is also the route Paul Theroux took in the 1970s and wrote about in his famous book The Great Railway Bazaar. Nowadays, travelling through Afghanistan and Pakistan is not as appealing as it used to be. The easiest route to India overland now is the one through China, Tibet and Nepal. With the Nepal Earthquake of 2015 The road between Tibet and Nepal was destroyed. It reopened in 2017 though, and travelling overland to India became again possible.
Beijing to Lhasa

Direct sleeper trains between Beijing and Lhasa run daily and take about 41 hours to cover the distance of 3757km between the two cities. In addition to the direct Beijing Lhasa Train, there are also trains to Lhasa from other big cities such as Xining, Chengdu and Shanghai. Travelling by train to Tibet has become increasingly popular, and with demand surpassing supply in the high season, train tickets can be relatively expensive.

While people might think that taking the train to Lhasa at 3656m above sea level wile help them avoid altitude sickness, this is not the case. The train simply doesn't spend enough time at ideal acclimatisation altitude. The highest point on the train's trajectory is above 5000m above sea level. Therefore, although oxygen is supplied on the train, it is a good idea to also plan some acclimatisation upon arrival in Lhasa. Or if you want to give your body more time to adapt, you could spent some days in and around Xining on the way.

Also note that travelling into Tibet Autonomous Region (also referred to as TAR or just Tibet) is very restricted. You will most probably be required to join a tour or arrange a private one with an official tour company. If you don't want to continue to Nepal and India, visiting the Kham and Amdo Tibetan regions that lie outside of the TAR might be a more hassle free way of experiencing Tibetan culture while in China.
Lhasa to Kathmandu

Google Lhasa to Kathmandu and a lot of tours will pop up. A lot of them are very similar. You will read "7 days Lhasa to Kathmandu budget group tour with visit to Everest Basecamp" at least a number of times. This is also because different Chinese and international agencies sell the same tours that are executed by a limited number of Tibetan travel companies. The land of Snows has a good independent description of what is to see along the road. Knowing what you want will certainly help you when comparing different tours. Cycling is also a popular way of covering the 1000km distance between both cities.
Into India

I have to admit that travelling beyond Kathmandu independently on this route would very probably go way beyond my ability to deal with chaos. Which does by no means mean that it is dangerous or impossible. It just isn't something I could do. Most travellers from Kathmandu to India have either Varanasi or Darjeeling as their first major destination. The route is mainly by bus. (The usual warnings for thieves, scammers and border crossings apply. )

Once in India trains are again at your disposition. India has a vast railway network. Around India in 80 Trains by Monisha Rajesh is an interesting read if you want to get an idea of what travelling this vast country by rail involves. Sadly, the India Rail Pass that she uses for her travel has been discontinued since late 2017. If you prefer buses, those seem to be plentiful as well.

For the less adventurous still wanting to discover the Indian subcontinent, overland tours could be an option. They are a form of group travel where an overland truck (a truck with seating) is your main mode of transportation. Usually large distances are covered, and the tours are often advertised as a way to discover a whole continent in one trip. Those kind of tours exist all over the world. They are particularly common in more far off continents or regions such as Africa, Latin-America and the silk road. Dragoman is the main provider in India, offering a tour around the whole of India, from Kathmandu to Kathmandu in 90 days.
What is next

Continuing your overland journey from India is not an easy task. It is supposed to be possible (but not easy) to travel through Myanmar to Thailand and the rest of South-east Asia. It might also be possible to catch a Freighter or Cruise ship from one of Indias ports onto your next destination. But these possibilities are rare, probably expensive and certainly not well documented. Note that there is currently no Ferry or similar transport between India and Sri Lanka, although they look close to each other on the map.

Researching overland travel is a hobby of mine. This article will cover destinations worldwide, and how to travel in between them. I'll mostly cover train and bus travel, bus also discuss how to cross oceans by freighter or sailing ship, as well as cycling and organised travel by overland truck where appropriate. If you want to learn more about overlanding in the sense of traveling the world in your own vehicle, this is not the right place though. I don't own a vehicle or even a drivers license, so this topic is not part of my research. The Article is split up into several blogposts. Here is a table of contents so that you can keep the overview:
